			<h1>CYBER SECURITY</h1>
			<p>Cybersecurity is the practice of defending against online attacks on programs, networks, and systems. These cyberattacks frequently aim to disrupt normal corporate operations, extort money from users, or gain access to, alter, or delete sensitive data. Given that there are now more devices than humans and that attackers are becoming more inventive, implementing effective cybersecurity measures is especially difficult.</p>

	<h1>A cyber or cybersecurity threat is a malicious act that aims to destroy data, steal data, or otherwise disrupt digital life. Cyberthreats include computer viruses, data breaches, denial-of-service attacks, and other attack methods.</h1>
	

	<div class="row">
		<div class="subject-col">
			<h3>Why is cybersecurity important?</h3>
			<p>Cybersecurity is crucial because it protects all forms of data from loss and destruction. Information systems used by the government and business sectors as well as sensitive data, personally identifiable information (PII), protected health information (PHI), personal information, and intellectual property data are all included.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="subject-col">
			<h3>What are the elements of cybersecurity and how does it work?</h3>
			<p>The subject of cybersecurity can be divided into a number of distinct parts, and it is essential for an organization's coordination within that field to have a successful cybersecurity program. Application security, information or data security, network security, and other sections are included in these sections.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="subject-col">
			<h3>What are the benefits of cybersecurity?</h3>
			<p>Cybersecurity is the process of guarding against loss, theft, or unauthorized access to networks, devices, and data. Buildings and the people who reside in them are protected from numerous physical threats by physical security, whilst digital technologies and their users are protected from cyberthreats by cybersecurity.</p>
		</div>
		
	</div>
	<!------- 2nd row ------->
	<div class="secondrow">
		<div class="subject-col">
			<h3>What are the top cybersecurity challenges?</h3>
			<p>Hackers, data loss, privacy, risk management, and changing cybersecurity strategies all pose ongoing challenges to cybersecurity. The number of cyberattacks is unlikely to fall in the near future. Furthermore, increased attack vectors, such as the arrival of the internet of things (IoT), increase the need to secure networks and devices.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="subject-col">
			<h3>What are the different types of cybersecurity threats?</h3>
			<p>Keeping up with new technologies, security trends, and threat intelligence is a difficult task. It is required to protect information and other assets from cyberthreats, which come in a variety of forms. Malware, Ransomware, Phishing, Social Engineering, and so on. </p>
		</div>
		<div class="subject-col">
			<h3>How is automation used in cybersecurity?</h3>
			<p>Automation has become an essential component in protecting businesses from the growing number and sophistication of cyberthreats. Using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning in areas with high-volume data streams can help improve cybersecurity in three areas: threat detection, threat mitigation, and threat prevention. Response to a threat as well as human augmentation.</p>

	<h1>"The direct collection, administration, and interpretation of business information as well as the retention of information for use in routine business processing make up a considerable portion of the competitive strategy of the majority of firms. Reputational harm, putting the business at a competitive disadvantage, and contract non-compliance are a few of the more evident effects of IS failures. It is important to not undervalue these effects.
